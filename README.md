# Hello there !

I am a bioinformatics student in Lyon, France. I got a Bachelor in Biology at the University of Lausanne (UNIL) in 2020. Currently in a interniship at LBBE (Laboratoire de Biologie et Biometrie Evolutive). I work on MetaDBGWAS.

# Interests:

My main interests in bioinformatics are the treatment of biological data by neural networks. I worked a bit with keras. 

# Languages:

Python (OO)
Javascript/HTML/css
bash
R
Starting with C++

# Repo:

You will find a repo for my work at the museum, one for the MNHN-Tree-Tools for easier dependencies access; a repo for a bug during my work with BRAKER2 (automated genome annotation tool); a repo for my work on a internet site for biochemical reaction visuals in AR (Augmented Reality). MetaDBGWAS is the extension of DBGWAS to a metagenomic scale.
